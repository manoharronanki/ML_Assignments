# ML Assignment 1

## Short Description: 
Jupiter notebook is the platform used for performing operations on numpy and matplotlib libraries in python. Numpy is useful for for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing where as Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.Here in this assignment i have implemeneted properties like shape,type,datatype of array and computing eigen vectors, eigen values of array along with caluclating sum of diagonal elements in array using numpy library in python and I have created a pie chart of programming languages using matplotlib library in python.

# ML Assignment 2

## Short Description: 
Classifaction programs are done in this assignment.Differenet data modelas are trained using naive bayes and svm classifiers which are basically linear classifiers.
By training the moldels we have found out naive bayes have provided better output when compared to the svm linear classifier.
